# Paid?

Im not sure if im going to make the client paid or not. I would like your suggestions if you have any idea on how this could work. If the client is paid it will be higher quality because I can hire devs to help me. If unpaid it may not be as high quality but it can be accessible to everyone. Not sure how much it will cost if paid. 


# Java

Ok so I am going to use java but not sure if there is any way to merge some way with another coding language as I am not very fammilar with minecraft client coding. If anyone can help me with this please feel free to contact me at Comicly#5090 on discord!

Hi! Instead of doing my updates in the description of the first repo edit of the day im going to be doing them here, I will still link the first update of the day,
but just the update code.
Anyway, heres today's news. Not a very long update but I'm on break rn so I wont be doing my us updates per day. I am going to do some updates tommorow morning as it is like 
1am for me. If anybody would like to help please let me know on discord (Comicly#5090)

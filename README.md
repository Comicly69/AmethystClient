# Paid?

Im not sure if im going to make the client paid or not. I would like your suggestions if you have any idea on how this could work. If the client is paid it will be higher quality because I can hire devs to help me. If unpaid it may not be as high quality but it can be accessible to everyone. Not sure how much it will cost if paid. 

# Update details
Every time I update something to do with the client it will have a special Id and I will update the version. I will not add the special id if it is just updating something with readme.md or anything else that doesnt effect the client

# Recent updates



# Java

Ok so I am going to use java but not sure if there is any way to merge some way with another coding language as I am not very fammilar with minecraft client coding. If anyone can help me with this please feel free to contact me at Comicly#5090 on discord!

# Design

I am working on the design for the ingame client but i kind of want to do something like vape that it has a external program that you use to enable/disable hacks, also a way to temperaly self-destruct but so you dont have to resart the game after u get screenshared.

# Developers

I know most people dont care about this, so feel free to ignore it. If you would like to help me with anything, from the github to the coding Please contact me @ Comicly#5090
